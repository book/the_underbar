A Perl-adjacent maybe-podcast, hosted by Philippe Bruhat (BooK).

## The concept

If there's one thing I like more than writing code, it's *talking*
about code. My best memories about code usually involve a late night
discussion with a drink in one hand and *no keyboard* in the other.

In 2024, I seriously started listening to podcasts. "Live conversation
with eventual interventions from the audience" is the format I find to
be the closest to the bar conversations I like so much, and I'd love to
listen to (and chat with) my friends from the open source community,
talking about random mostly technical topics.

So, I figured I should just try it! How hard can it be to setup a
conference call, invite a few interesting people, pick a topic to start
the conversation, hit "record", and stop after roughly one hour?
And make the recording public afterwards, for others to enjoy.

(If you don't like the undertones of "bar", you can think of this as "campfire stories".)
