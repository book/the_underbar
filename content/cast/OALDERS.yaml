bio: >
  You might recognize Olaf as the guy behind MetaCPAN. He co-founded
  the project in late 2010 as a means to aggregate data for an iOS
  application. The phone app fizzled, but MetaCPAN took on a life of its
  own. Olaf has been part of the team working on it ever since. MetaCPAN
  is a user-friendly search and discovery platform for Perl modules and
  distributions, based on CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network).

  When Olaf is not working on websites, he is spending time with
  his family and his dog. He enjoys open-water swimming, biking, and
  running. He is in the pool regularly with his local Masters Swim
  Club. He is currently recording guitar parts for a post-punk song
  cycle about Ragnar√∂k.
