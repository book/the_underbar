title: The New Perl Logo
description: >
  This episode was an experiment: how hard can it be to record a podcast?
  Find a topic (the new Perl logo), a few people who have something to
  say about it, schedule a meeting, hit record, and presto, you are
  now a podcaster. And because it was an experiment, we numbered it 0.
