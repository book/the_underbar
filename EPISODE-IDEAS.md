Some discussion of the 25+ years old project.

## The dependency on Makefiles

CPAN distribution installers and builders
(ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build, Module::Install, ...)

From #pts, 2025-12-11:

```
<leont> It went this way because MakeMaker predates CPAN.pm. It started with core needing something to build its modules, something that integrated with perl's own configuration.
<leont> Makefile.PL exists because Makefile.SH couldn't handle things anymore by late 1994
<leont> "It all made sense in 1995"
<BooK> I would love to have some relevant people talk about how we depend on make to install Perl modules on the podcast
<BooK> and yeah, ending up injecting text in a generated Makefile via heredocs in a Perl script sounds... convoluted 
```
